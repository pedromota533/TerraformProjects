# Task:

Automatized solution pipe-line that uses the AWS & Azure to run tests and validation, and provide o feedback regard to the test eventually. 

More detailed, the configuration must be highly modal meaning that it's not necessary to processed meaning that the parameters should define if the configuration is going to be executed. 

Scripts that I will implement:



.github folder will contain all the workflow that we need.

terraform folder will be responible with the configuration and it will have aws that is related to aws configuration and then the azure that will be responsible with the azure.





### Terraform:
- Create of the Network
- Creation of the resources
- Create of Variables



### Notes: 

To be able to execute GitHub actions inside of our server we need the GitHub self hosted runner.

I need to figure it out why would I need Ansible, because in the linux i could only use bash.

We are going to use EC2 and Azure VM's
