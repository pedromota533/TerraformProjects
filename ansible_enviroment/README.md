# Ansible GitHub Runner Setup Environment

## Overview

This directory contains an Ansible-based automation solution for deploying and managing GitHub Actions self-hosted runners on remote machines. The playbook handles the complete lifecycle of runners: installation, configuration, execution, and removal.

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python 3** - Required for Ansible and virtual environment
- **Bash** - Shell interpreter
- **SSH Access** - To target EC2 instances
- **Terraform** - Must be run first to provision infrastructure and generate inventory

### Auto-Installed Dependencies
The `run` script automatically installs the following in a Python virtual environment:
- **Ansible** - Configuration management tool
- **Python dependencies** - Managed via `requirements.txt`

**Note:** You do NOT need to manually install Ansible. The `run` script handles all setup automatically.

```

## Workflow

### Complete Workflow (Terraform → Ansible)

2. **Configure GitHub Runner Token**
   - Edit `../config/config.ini`
   - Set the `github_runner_token` value (get from GitHub repo settings)

3. **Run Ansible Deployment**
   ```bash
   cd ../ansible_enviroment
   ./run
   ```

The `run` script will:
- ✓ Validate that `../config/config.ini` exists
- ✓ Validate that `github_runner_token` is not empty
- ✓ Check that Python 3 is installed
- ✓ Create Python virtual environment (if needed)
- ✓ Install Ansible in virtual environment
- ✓ Execute the Ansible playbook
- ✓ Report success or failure with appropriate exit codes

### Script Exit Codes

The `run` script uses specific exit codes for different failure scenarios:

| Exit Code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Success - Ansible playbook completed successfully |
| 1 | Configuration file `../config/config.ini` not found |
| 2 | GitHub runner token is empty in config |
| 3 | Python 3 is not installed |
| 4 | Failed to create Python virtual environment |
| 5 | Failed to activate Python virtual environment |
| 6 | Failed to install Ansible |
| 7+ | Ansible playbook failed (exit code from ansible-playbook) |

## Usage

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**From anywhere in the project:**
```bash
cd ansible_enviroment
./run
```

**The script handles everything:**
- Validates configuration
- Sets up Python environment
- Installs Ansible
- Runs the playbook
- Reports results

### Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: First Time Setup (Inside ansible_enviroment)

```bash
# You are in: ~/terraform-github-contructor/ansible_enviroment
chmod +x ./run
./run
```

**What happens:**
1. Checks if `../config/config.ini` exists
2. Validates GitHub token is set
3. Creates `.venv/` directory
4. Installs Ansible
5. Runs playbook against all runners
6. Creates `logs/` directory with execution logs

#### Use Case 2: Running from Project Root

```bash
# You are in: ~/terraform-github-contructor
cd ansible_enviroment && ./run
```

#### Use Case 3: Re-running After Changes

```bash
# You are in: ~/terraform-github-contructor/ansible_enviroment
# Virtual environment already exists, script reuses it
./run
```
#### Use Case 4: Manual Playbook Execution (Advanced)

If you need more control or want to pass custom variables:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run with custom parameters
ansible-playbook run-scripts.yml \
  -i ../config/config.ini \
  -e "github_runner_version=2.330.0" \
  -e "github_runner_labels=self-hosted,linux,x64,custom" \
  --limit runner-01
```

### Prerequisites
Before running the `run` script, ensure:
1. **Python 3 installed** - Check with `python3 --version`
2. **SSH access configured** - SSH key specified in `config.ini`
3. **Terraform executed** - Infrastructure provisioned and `config.ini` generated
4. **GitHub token set** - `github_runner_token` in `../config/config.ini`
5. **Target hosts running** - EC2 instances are up and accessible

### Inventory File
The inventory file is **automatically generated by Terraform** and located at `../config/config.ini`.

**Example format:**
```ini
[runners]
# Individual IPs (one per line)
1.2.3.4
5.6.7.8

[runners:vars]
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/aws_permision_file_work.pem
ansible_user=ubuntu
ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null'
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

# GitHub Runner Configuration
github_repo_url=https://github.com/owner/repo
github_runner_token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
github_runner_version=2.329.0
github_runner_dir=/home/ubuntu/actions-runner
github_runner_labels=self-hosted,linux,x64
remove_runner=false
```

## Components

### Scripts

#### `00-install-dependencies.sh`

Installs system-level dependencies required for the GitHub runner.

**What it does:**
- Updates system packages
- Installs essennal tools: `jq`, `wget`, `unzip`
- Validates that critical commands are available

**Execution:** Rtial tools: `curl`, `tar`, `git`, `coreutils`
- Installs optiouns as root

#### `10-github_runner_setup.sh`

Main runner installation and configuration script with robust error handling.

**What it does:**
- Downloads GitHub Actions runner (version 2.329.0 by default)
- Validates download integrity using SHA256 hash
- Extracts runner archive
- Configures runner with provided credentials
- Attempts to install as systemd service
- Falls back to background process if service installation fails
- Includes smart skip logic: won't reinstall if runner is already healthy

**Environment Variables:**
- `REPO_URL`: GitHub repository URL (required)
- `RUNNER_TOKEN`: Registration token (required)
- `RUNNER_VERSION`: Runner version (default: 2.329.0)
- `RUNNER_DIR`: Installation directory (default: ~/actions-runner)
- `RUNNER_NAME`: Runner name (default: hostname-runner)
- `RUNNER_LABELS`: Custom labels (default: self-hosted,linux,x64)

**Execution:** Runs as ansible_user

#### `20-remove-github-runner.sh`

Conditional removal script for cleaning up GitHub runners.

**What it does:**
- Only executes if `REMOVE_RUNNER=true`
- Stops systemd service if running
- Kills background process if exists
- Removes runner configuration from GitHub
- Deletes runner directory completely

**Environment Variables:**
- `REMOVE_RUNNER`: Must be set to `true` to execute removal
- `RUNNER_TOKEN`: Required for configuration removal
- `RUNNER_DIR`: Directory to remove (default: ~/actions-runner)

**Execution:** Runs as ansible_user

## Logging
All script outputs are saved to the `logs/` directory in the playbook directory:

```
logs/
├── runner-01_00-install-dependencies.sh.log
├── runner-01_10-github_runner_setup.sh.log
├── runner-02_00-install-dependencies.sh.log
└── runner-02_10-github_runner_setup.sh.log
```

Failed scripts are marked with `_FAILED` suffix:
```
logs/runner-01_10-github_runner_setup.sh_FAILED.log
```

Each log file contains:
- STDOUT output
- STDERR output
- Return code

## How It Works (PlayBook)

2. **Discovery Phase (Ansible)**
   - Ansible finds all `*.sh` files in `scripts/` directory
   - Creates remote temporary directory `/tmp/ansible_scripts`

3. **Dependency Installation (Scripts `0X-*`)**
   - Copies scripts to remote hosts
   - Executes as root user
   - Installs system packages and tools

4. **Runner Setup (Scripts `1X-*`)**
   - Creates runner directory with correct ownership
   - Executes as ansible_user
   - Passes environment variables for configuration
   - Downloads, validates, and installs runner
   - Starts runner as service or background process

5. **Logging and Cleanup**
   - Saves all stdout/stderr to local log files
   - Removes temporary scripts directory on remote hosts

## Advanced Usage

### Removing Runners
To remove all runners from hosts:

1. Edit `../config/config.ini`
2. Set `remove_runner=true`
3. Run: `./run`

Or manually:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
ansible-playbook run-scripts.yml -i ../config/config.ini -e "remove_runner=true"
```

### Running Against Specific Hosts

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
ansible-playbook run-scripts.yml -i ../config/config.ini --limit 52.29.136.181
```

### Updating Runner Version

Edit `../config/config.ini`:
```ini
github_runner_version=2.330.0
```

Then run: `./run`

Don't forget to update the `EXPECTED_HASH` in `scripts/10-github_runner_setup.sh:16` for the new version.

## Error Handling

- All scripts use `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
- Failed scripts are logged with `_FAILED` suffix
- Playbook continues execution even if individual scripts fail
- Runner setup includes automatic retry with full reinstall
- Hash validation prevents corrupted downloads
- The `run` script uses `set -e` to exit on first error

## Security Considerations

- Runner tokens should be treated as secrets
- Never commit `config.ini` with real tokens to git
- Use Ansible Vault for sensitive variables in production
- SHA256 hash validation ensures download integrity
- Scripts run with minimum required privileges
- Temporary files are cleaned up after execution
- SSH strict host key checking is disabled for automation (consider enabling in production)


### Complete Integration Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Provision infrastructure (see main project README)
# Terraform will create EC2 instances and generate config.ini

# 2. Configure GitHub token if not there
vim ../config/config.ini  # Set github_runner_token

# 3. Deploy runners
cd ansible_enviroment
./run

# 4. Verify deployment
# Check logs in ./logs/
# Check GitHub repo settings → Actions → Runners
```


### What Ansible Provides:
- System dependency installation
- GitHub runner download and configuration
- Service management
- Centralized logging

## Maintenance

### Checking Runner Status

SSH to host and check:
```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

### Viewing Runner Logs

On remote host:
```bash
tail -f ~/actions-runner/_diag/Runner_*.log
```

Or check local Ansible logs:
```bash
cat logs/runner-01_10-github_runner_setup.sh.log
```

### Updating Runners

1. Update version in `../config/config.ini`
2. Run: `./run`

### Cleaning Up

Remove all runners:
```bash
# Set remove_runner=true in config.ini
./run
```

Remove local environment:
```bash
rm -rf .venv/ logs/ requirements.txt
```

## Customization

### Adding New Scripts

1. Create a new shell script in `scripts/` directory
2. Use numeric prefix to control execution order
   - `0X-` for root execution
   - `1X-9X-` for user execution
3. Make script executable: `chmod +x scripts/XX-name.sh`
4. Use environment variables passed by playbook

### Modifying the `run` Script

The `run` script is designed to be customized. Common modifications:

- Change inventory location: Update `INVENTORY_LOCATION` variable
- Add additional validation checks
- Install additional Python packages
- Add pre/post execution hooks

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:
1. Follow the naming convention
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add logging statements
4. Document environment variables
5. Test in isolation before integration
